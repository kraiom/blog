title: Hello World!
---
Hello everyone! This is our very first post on our blog! Luckily we'll keep you up to date on how our games are going, so that you can give us feedback and get closer to us.

If you haven't heard about us before, it's not a big deal at all. Actually we've just started on this game dev world. We're a small Brazilian team passionate for games and programming, so we want to provide the world even more fun stuff.

That's it!
