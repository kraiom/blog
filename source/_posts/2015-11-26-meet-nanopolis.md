We are very happy to introduce you to Nanopolis!

Nanopolis is our very first game built using Phaser with its isometric plugin. It's meant to be a very simple yet challenging puzzle where you must build up a path for cars to follow. You'll need to build it smartly otherswise you might run out of time and lose the game.

As for now we only have a map reader (that reads a file and build the map) and basic movements for the car: The car pops up from a source and then smoothly follows it path turning on curves and finally vanishes when entering the target.

As you can see there are a lot of things to be done yet. It's a very early screenshot of the development of this game that should be out soon for free.

We'll keep you up to date on our improvements!
